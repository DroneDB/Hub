## AI Agent Guidelines

### Code Analysis
- **Read existing code patterns** before implementing new features
- **Understand the complete data flow** from input files to database storage
- **Check for existing utilities** before writing new helper functions
- **Respect the layered architecture** - don't bypass abstraction layers

### Making Changes
- **Always ask for confirmation** before modifying code
- **Provide detailed explanations** of changes and their impact
- **Consider backwards compatibility** for API changes
- **Test changes thoroughly** including edge cases

### Problem Solving
- **Break down complex tasks** into smaller, manageable components
- **Leverage existing infrastructure** rather than reinventing solutions
- **Consider performance implications** of proposed changes
- **Think about error scenarios** and how to handle them gracefully

### Documentation
- **Comment complex algorithms** and spatial operations
- **Document API changes** with clear examples
- **Explain architectural decisions** for future maintainers
- **Keep README and docs updated** with significant changes

## Quality Assurance
- **Run full test suite** before proposing changes
- **Verify cross-platform compatibility**
- **Check memory leaks** with tools like Valgrind
- **Validate spatial operations** with known test datasets
- **Performance regression testing** for core operations
